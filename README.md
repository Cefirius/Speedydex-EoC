# Speedydex-EoC
Replicates Speedydex through EoCs. 

There's two versions:
- speedydex_eoc: Higher dex values increase your speed and lower dex values decrease it.
- speedydex_eoc_no_slowdown: Higher dex values increase your speed but lower dex values DON'T decrease it.

The default offset value is 8, and the default speed increase per point is 2. Tweak it to your heart's content.
